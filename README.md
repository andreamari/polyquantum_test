# The PolyQuantum project
_Collaborative research in quantum science._

## About
The _PolyQuantum_ project is an experiment of collaborative research in the field of quantum science.
It is inspired by the successful [PolyMath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) but, instead of being structured as a blog, it is hosted as a GitHub repository.
The mission of the PolyQuantum project is to help share ideas and to stimulate collaborative research projects in quantum science.

## Why GitHub?
GitHub is based on the distributed version-control system [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) which, although specifically designed for developing software, is particularely convenient also for the aims of the PolyQuantum project. In a Git repository, the whole history of changes applied to any file is permanently tracked and recorded. This is a strong incentive for sharing ideas and collaborating in resaerch projects. Indeed, the fact that each contribution is public and permanently tracked helps to avoid plagiarism and misappropriations of intellectual property.

## How to create a new project with a new idea
1. Open a new **issue** to propose a new idea or a new problem.
2. Once refined, create a subfolder in `/documents/` folder.  
   - Name the subfolder after the issue number (e.g., `/documents/42/`).
   - Create or edit a Markdown document explaining your idea /documents/42/0-main.md`).
   - Include metadata at the top: author, date, source issue.  
3. Open a Pull Request to merge the subfolder and its internal file.  

## How to contribute to an existing project
1. Discuss and interact directly by commenting on an existing issue.
2. Each time the discussion produces original material that is worth preserving (ideas, solutions, calculations, etc..), create or edit a Markdown file in the `/documents/` folder.
3. Open a Pull Request to merge the file.  

## Issues vs. Markdown files
- **Issues** are for open brainstorming, discussions, and comments.  
- **Markdown files** are for finalized ideas and serve as a permanent record.  

## Attribution
4. After merging a `.md` document, your contribution and your authorship will be permanently preserved in Git history. This avoids plagiarism.
