# Polyquantum
_Collaborative research in quantum science._

## About
_Polyquantum_ is an experiment of open collaborative research in the field of quantum science.
In Polyquantum, you can share a new research idea or collaborate on an existing one. A unique feature of _Polyquantum_ is the transparent tracking of each scientific contribution based on [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), such that authorship will be permanently preserved in Git history. 
The Polyquantum project is inspired by the successful [Polymath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) but, instead of being structured as a [blog](https://polymathprojects.org/)), it is hosted as a GitHub repository.

## How to create a new research project
1. Open a new **issue** to share a new research idea or a new problem.
2. Once refined, create a subfolder in `/documents/` folder.  
   - Name the subfolder after the issue number (e.g., `/documents/42/`).
   - Create or edit a Markdown document explaining your idea (e.g., `/documents/42/0-main.md`).
   - Include metadata at the top: author, date, source issue.  
3. Open a Pull Request to merge the subfolder and its internal file.  

## How to contribute to an existing project
1. Go to the _Issues_ section and explore the list of all existing projects.
1. Discuss and interact directly by commenting on a specific issue.
2. Each time the discussion produces original material that is worth preserving (ideas, solutions, calculations, etc..), create or edit a Markdown document in the issue subfolder (e.g., `/documents/42/1-solution.md`, `/documents/42/2-alternative-solution.md`, _etc._).
3. Open a Pull Request to merge your file.  

## Issues vs. Markdown files
- **Issues** are for open brainstorming, discussions, and comments.  
- **Markdown files** are for finalized ideas and serve as a permanent record.

## Attribution
4. After merging a `.md` document, your contribution and your authorship will be permanently preserved in Git history. This avoids plagiarism.
