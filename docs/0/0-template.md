# Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?

Consider the following wave function describing the quantum state of two distant particles:

$$
\Psi(x_1, x_2) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{\hbar}(x_1 - x_2+ x_0)p}  dp
$$

It is easy to check that this is a simultaneous eigenstate of the operators $\hat x_ =\hat x_1 - \hat x_2$ and $\hat p_+= \hat p_1 + \hat p_2$.
