# On the extended formula proposed by C. Charlie

In [Polyquantum 1.1](1-idea.md) B. Bob and I proposed the formula $E=mc^2$.
In [Polyquantum 1.2](1-contribution.md) C. Charlie extended it to a particle moving at velocity $v$:

$$
E =  \frac{m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{v}{c} \right)^2}} ,
$$

where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle [^1].

I believe the new formula is interesting and correct. 
Moreover, in this document, I would like to give a further formula in which the energy is expressed as a function of the momentum $p$ of the particle
instead of its velocity $v$.


For a particle moving with linear momentum $p$, its relativistic energy is given by

$$
E = \sqrt{ (m_0 c^2)^2 + (p c)^2 },
$$

where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle.
