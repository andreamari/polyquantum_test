## Example

# An extension of the initial formula by Alice and Bob
_C. Charlie_\
_University of Charlie_

The formula $E=mc^2$ proposed by Alice and Bob in [Polyquantum 1.1](1-idea.md) is very interesting.
In this document, we extend it to moving particles.

We argue that, for a particle moving at velocity $v$, its relativistic energy is given by

$$
E =  \frac{m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{v}{c} \right)^2}} ,
$$

where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle [^1].
