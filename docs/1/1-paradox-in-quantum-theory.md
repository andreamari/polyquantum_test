# Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?

Consider the following wave function describing the quantum state of two distant particles:

$$
\Psi(x_1, x_2) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{\hbar}(x_1 - x_2+ x_0)p}  dp
$$

It is easy to check that this is a simultaneous eigenstate of the operators $\hat x_- =\hat x_1 - \hat x_2$ and $\hat p_+= \hat p_1 + \hat p_2$.
This means that by measuring the observable $\hat x_1$ or $\hat p_1$ of the first particle, one can deduce with infinite precision the value of $\hat x_2$ or $\hat p_2$ of the second particle.

The fact that we can know the value of $\hat x_2$ or $\hat p_2$, *without interacting* with the second particle, means that

1. both quantities $\hat x_2$ and $\hat p_2$ are *elements of reality* of the second particle, i.e., they correspond to well-defined properties of the second particle.

However, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle [^1],  the commutator $[\hat x_2, \hat p_2]=i\hbar$ implies that

2. $\hat x_2$ and $\hat p_2$ cannot be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision. So they cannot simultaneously be *elements of reality*.

Does the contradiction between (1) and (2) imply that quantum theory is not a complete description of reality?
