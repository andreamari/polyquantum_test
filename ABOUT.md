## Inspiration and name origin
The Polyquantum project is inspired by the successful [Polymath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) by  [Timothy Gowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers) and [Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao). This explains the origin of the name _Polyquantum_. 
The main differences are the following:
 - Polymath is about mathematical research. Polyquantum is about quantum research.
 - Polymath is structured as a [blog](https://polymathprojects.org/). Polyquantum is structured as a GitHub repository.
 - Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao are both [Fields medalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal). I'm not. Hopefully, a negligible detail.
