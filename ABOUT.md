## What is Polyquantum?

_Polyquantum_ is an open platform for collaborative research in quantum science, structured as a GitHub repository.  
It allows researchers to:

- üí° Share new research ideas openly  
- üõ†Ô∏è Collaborate on ongoing projects proposed by others  
- üìù Preserve and track research contributions transparently  

A key feature of Polyquantum is the transparent tracking of authorship.  
By using [Git](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software))‚Äôs distributed version control, every research step is permanently recorded in Markdown documents, ensuring proper recognition of contributors.  

üëâ More details about Polyquantum can be found in the [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.md) page.

## Aim of Polyquantum

The aim of Polyquantum is to facilitate open and transparent collaborations at every step of the research process: from the initial brainstorming of ideas to the final publication of results.

While there are many platforms for openly sharing finalized scientific work (e.g., open-access journals and preprint servers such as [arXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv)), there are few solutions for sharing early-stage ideas and the intermediate steps of research. These include:  

- brainstorming of ideas,
- discussions with collaborators,  
- connections with existing literature,  
- tentative solutions,  
- failures and changes of direction,  
- experimental designs,
- critical analysis of results,  
- planning of the final manuscript.  

The goal of Polyquantum is to fill this gap.

## Inspirations and name origin

The Polyquantum project is inspired by the successful [Polymath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) initiated by [Timothy Gowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers) and [Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao). This explains the origin of the name _Polyquantum_. 
The main differences are:
 - Polymath is about mathematical research. Polyquantum is about quantum research.
 - Polymath is structured as a [blog](https://polymathprojects.org/). Polyquantum is structured as a GitHub repository.
 - Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao are both [Fields medalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal). I'm not. (A minor detail...)

The approach of Polyquantum is explicitly inspired by methodologies and tools from [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). GitHub and the underlying Git system are powerful, state-of-the-art tools for collaborative software development. Polyquantum aims to apply these same tools to open scientific research, recognizing that both domains share similar needs:  
- efficient collaborative writing of documents,  
- permanent recording of history,  
- transparent and traceable authorship.  

## Aknowledgemnts
I acknowledge Nathan Shammah and Will Zeng for discussions on the initial idea of Polyquantum back in 2020 and for the opportunity to pitch it with a lightning talk at [UnitaryCON 2023](https://unitary.foundation/community/2023/unitaryCON/). I also thank Stefano Zippilli, Arturo Arvizu for their help in testing and improving the structure of this repository.
