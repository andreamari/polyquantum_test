## About Polyquantum
Polyquantum is a platform for open collaborative research in the field of quantum science, structured as a GitHub repository. In Polyquantum, users can openly share a new research idea or collaborate on an existing one. A unique feature of Polyquantum is the transparent tracking of each scientific contribution, based on [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), ensuring that authorship of each step of the research process is permanently preserved in the Git history. 

## Aim of Polyquantum
Today, there is a large consensus on the importance of sharing scientific publications in open-access journals or open-access preprint repositories (such as the [arXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv)). However, typically, scientists are very jealous of their research ideas and keep all the steps of their work _closed_ until a final publication is produced. This is not necessarily a wrong behavior and is actually quite understandable given the risk of [scientific plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism).
The aim of Polyquantum is to facilitate an open and transparent approach during all the steps of the research process: From the initial brainstorming of ideas to the final publication of the associated results.

## Inspiration and name origin
The Polyquantum project is inspired by the successful [Polymath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) by  [Timothy Gowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers) and [Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao). This explains the origin of the name _Polyquantum_. 
The main differences are the following:
 - Polymath is about mathematical research. Polyquantum is about quantum research.
 - Polymath is structured as a [blog](https://polymathprojects.org/). Polyquantum is structured as a GitHub repository.
 - Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao are both [Fields medalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal). I'm not.
