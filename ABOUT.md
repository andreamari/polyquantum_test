## What is Polyquantum?
Polyquantum is a platform, structured as a GitHub repository, for open collaborative research in the field of quantum science.
In Polyquantum, users can openly share a new research idea or collaborate on research projects proposed by other users.

A unique feature of Polyquantum is the transparent tracking of scientific contributions. This is achieved through the distributed version control system [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), ensuring that authorship is properly recognized by permanently recording research documents in the Git history. 

## Aim of Polyquantum
The aim of Polyquantum is to facilitate open and transparent collaborations during all the steps of the research process: From the initial brainstorming of ideas to the final publication of the associated results.

There exist many solutions for sharing finalized scientific works: open-access journals, open-access preprint servers (e.g., [arXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv)).
The are instead few solutions for sharing early-stage research ideas and all the intermediate steps typical of a research process: Discussions with collaborators, connections with existing literature, tentative solutions, failures, change of directions, design of experiments, critical validation of the results, planning of the final manuscript, etc.. The goal of Polyquantum is to fill this gap.

## Inspiration and name origin
The Polyquantum project is inspired by the successful [Polymath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) by  [Timothy Gowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers) and [Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao). This explains the origin of the name _Polyquantum_. 
The main differences between Polyquantum and Polymath are the following:
 - Polymath is about mathematical research. Polyquantum is about quantum research.
 - Polymath is structured as a [blog](https://polymathprojects.org/). Polyquantum is structured as a GitHub repository.
 - Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao are both [Fields medalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal). I'm not. (A minor detail...)

The approach of Polyquantum is also clearly inspired by the methodologies and the tools of [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).
Indeed, both GitHub and the underlying Git system are state-of-the-art tools routinely used in open-source software development.
The goal of Polyquantum is to apply the same methodologies and the same powerful tools that emerged in the context of open-source software to the context of open scientific research. The underpinning assumption is that both fields share the same basic functionalities: efficient collaborative writing of text documents, permanent recording of history, and clear authorship.

## Aknowledgemnts
I acknowledge useful discussions with Nathan Shammah and Will Zeng about the early-stage idea of the Polyquantum project.
The same idea was presented in 2023 as a lightning talk at [UnitaryCON 2023](https://unitary.foundation/community/2023/unitaryCON/).
