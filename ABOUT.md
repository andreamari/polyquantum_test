## Origin of the name Polyquantum and inspiration
The Polyquantum project is inspired by the successful [Polymath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) by [Timothy Gowers]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers)) and [Terence Tao]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao)). This explains the name "Polyquantum". 
The main differences are the following. Polymath is about mathematical research, while Polyquantum is about quantum research. Polymath is structured as a [blog](https://polymathprojects.org/), while Polyquantum is hosted a GitHub repository. T
Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao are both ([Fields medalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal), I'm not.
