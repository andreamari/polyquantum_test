# License for contributions

## Default licence: Polyquantum perpetual non-exclusive license to distribute

This license is applied by default to all contributions, unless users explicitly select alternative options (see next section).

- I grant Polyquantum a perpetual, non-exclusive license to distribute the contributed material.
- I certify that I have the right to grant this license.
- I understand that the contributed content cannot be completely removed once accepted and merged.
- I understand that Poliquantum reserves the right to reclassify or reject any contributed content.

This is the same licence recommended by the [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/license.html) preprint repository. It gives Polyquantum the right to distribute your contribution, and it is the **recommended option** if you wish to publish your final results in a scientific journal.
